## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish 
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.
  
### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**<br>

>Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.

**Solution**: Refresh the project in Eclipse:
Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
>Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.

**Solution**: Run tests using Gradle once (to refresh the libraries).

 

## Design

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given below explains the high-level design of the App, showing which components interact with which other components.<br>
![Architecture](images/A_overall.png)<br>
Given below is a quick overview of each component.
<br>
####Main
`Main` has only one class called [`Main`](). It is responsible for:
* Launching app: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* Shutting down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

####Commons
[`Commons`]() represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used for interaction between componenets.(a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>
The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
  - Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
  - Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.
![Sequence Diagram](images/delete_command.png)
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskTrackerChangedEvent` when the T-T data are changed,instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the '**Last Updated**' time. <br>
![Sequence Diagram](images/events_center.png)
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

####Logic
![Logic](images/A_Logic.png)<br>
**API** : [`Logic.java`]()

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

####UI
![UI](images/A_UI.png)<br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`]()

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`]() is specified in[`MainWindow.fxml`]()

The `UI` component,
  - Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
  - Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
  - Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

####Model
![Model](images/A_Model.png)<br>

**API** : [`Model.java`]()

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the task data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### Storage component

![Storage](images/A_Storage.png)<br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/main/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
  - can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
  - can save the Task-Tracker data in xml format and read it back.

#### Common classes

The classes used by multiple components are in the `tasktracker.main.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

####Logging Levels

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`)

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task-Tracker Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
    >   * Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
    >   * Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix D : Glossary

## Appendix E : Product Survey

We did a market survey in order to study the existing products out there for the consumers. We looked at a wide variety of task managers- Taskwarrior, Calendar.vim, Gcalcli, Wunderlist, Todo.txt and Evernote. We will talk about the strengths and flaws of each of them.

`Taskwarrior` is a free and open source software that uses the command line. Its biggest strength is its simple user interface and lightweight design. However, it does not support reminders and is only available for Linux and OSX.

`Calendar.vim` is another software we studied. It is an only-Linux software which runs via the vim text editor. It too is lightweight and utilises a CLI to perform its operations. But it does not support subtasks, has no possibility of syncing with other calendars such as Google Calendar, and has no reminders. It is very basic in its operations. Gcalcli is also Linux and OSX based, and supports reminders also, but it doesn�t work offline.

Moving on to **GUI** task managers. `Wunderlist` is a popular task manager software. It has Google integration,  supports integration, has reminders and is available on multiple platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. But it doesn�t support subtasks.

`Todo.txt` is another GUI task manager which is available on many platforms and is free. Its drawbacks are that it has no reminders or support for subtasks.
`Evernote` was the most popular task manager we studied. It supports Google integration and subtasks, is available across multiple platforms and has reminders. The only big drawback of Evernote is that it is not completely free and some features are available only after payment.
