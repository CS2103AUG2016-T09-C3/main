### 4. **DONE**

You can mark tasks as done after they have been completed. Tasks marked as done will not appear in the main list, but can be viewed by the LIST command (see section 3.2).

The format to mark a task as done is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `done <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel.


<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `do laundry monday 4pm`

*   `done 1` will mark the `do laundry` task as done.

### 5. **EDIT**

You can use the EDIT command to modify existing tasks in **T-T**.

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `edit <task index> <new task> [new date1] [new date2] [-h | -m | -l] ` <br>

  * `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel.

<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

<img src="images/edit_command1.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>

*  `edit 1 wash dishes tuesday 6pm -h` will edit the existing `wash dishes` task to `use dishes` and change the date from **monday** to **tuesday** , time from **4pm** to **6pm** and priority from **medium** to **high**.
<br>
<img src="images/edit_command2.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>
### 6. **UNDO**

You can use the UNDO command to revert the previous commands you have entered in the session.

The format to undo the previous command is simply : 
&nbsp; &nbsp; `undo` <br>

>      Undo can be used to revert back add, delete, done, edit and clear commands.

<br> For example : <br>
Entering `undo` after executing the delete command will bring back the deleted task.

### 7. **REDO**

You can use the REDO command to redo the previous undo you have executed in the session.

The format to undo the previous command is simply : 
&nbsp; &nbsp; `redo` <br>

>Redo can be used to revert back undos pertaining to add, delete, done, edit and  clear commands.

<br> For example : <br>
Entering `redo` after executing an undo for delete will delete the specific task again.

### 8. **SEARCH**

You can use the SEARCH command to filter out specific tasks from the entire list of tasks.

The format to search for certain tasks is :  
    `search <keyword>`  

>•   The tasks you are looking for can be obtained by typing in any word that is contained within the tasks' messages.
•   If multiple tasks contain the entered keyword, all matching tasks will be displayed.


For example:  

Let say there is a task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

<br>
<img src="images/search_command1.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>

*   `search dishes` will show the existing `wash dishes` task.

<br>
<img src="images/search_command2.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>

### 9. **SORT** 

You can use the SORT command to sort tasks in the List Panel according to alphabetic order or date.

The format to sort a list of tasks is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `sort < date | name >`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified.

For example:
*   `sort date` will sort the list of tasks based on their dates, displaying the closest deadlines at the top.
*   `sort name` will sort the list lexicographically. 

<br>

### 10. **STORAGE** 

You can change the location of the xml file in which tasks are being stored in your PC.

The format to change storage location is :
  <br>  `storage <filepath>` <br>

The storage command can be used to change the storage location of tasks. Tasks are stored on your computer in an XML file.

>   *  Filepath must be of an XML file.
>   *  If the XML file mentioned at the filepath does not exist, a new XML file will be created by TaskTracker at the specified location.
>   *  All data of the pre-existing tasks will be copied to the new XML file.

<br> For example : <br>

Entering `storage C://users/JohnDoe/NewFile.xml` will change the storage location to NewFile.xml.

#### Storage
[`Storage`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/storage/Storage.java) is exposed through [`StorageManager`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/storage/StorageManager.java), and interacts with [`UserPrefsStorage`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/storage/UserPrefsStorage.java) and [`TaskTrackerStorage`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/storage/TaskTrackerStorage.java) interfaces. The functionalities of these 2 interfaces are exposed by the [`JsonUserPrefsStorage`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/storage/JsonUserPrefsStorage.java) and [`XmlTaskTrackerStorage`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/storage/XmlTaskTrackerStorage.java) respectively.
![Storage](images/A_storage.png)<br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/main/storage/Storage.java)

* `UserPref` objects and TaskTracker data are saved in json format and can be read back.
* Task data are saved in XML format and can be read back

#### Commons
[`Commons`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/tree/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/commons) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. These classes are furthered separated into packages - `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `utils`

* `core` - Essential classes used for implementation in different components of TaskTracker
* `events` - Classes that address and assist in event changes, mainly used by EventBus and EventManager
* `exceptions` - Consists of classes that handle exceptions that may occur in TaskTracker.
* `util` - Classes that provides additional utilities to assist in different components
  
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used for interaction between componenets.(a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`. <br>
![Sequence Diagram](images/delete_command.png) <br>
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskTrackerChangedEvent` when the T-T data are changed,instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the '**Last Updated**' time. <br>
![Sequence Diagram](images/events_center.png) <br>
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

####Logging Levels

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`)

## Dev Ops

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repository with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
