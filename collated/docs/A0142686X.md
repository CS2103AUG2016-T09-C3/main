#### Storage

![Storage](images/A_storage.png)<br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/main/storage/Storage.java)

* UserPref` objects and TaskTracker data are saved in json format and can be read back.
* Task data are saved in XML format and can be read back

#### Common classes

The classes used by multiple components are in the `tasktracker.main.commons` package.

These classes are furthered separated into packages - `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `utils`

* `core` - Essential classes used for implementation in different components of TaskTracker
* `events` - Classes that address and assist in event changes, mainly used by EventBus and EventManager
* `exceptions` - Consists of classes that handle exceptions that may occur in TaskTracker.
* `util` - Classes that provides additional utilities to assist in different components

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

####Logging Levels

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`)

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Code Quality Evaluation

We use [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) to perform testing and evaluation on the code quality and report issues on our projects.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repository with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### 4. **DONE** TASK

The format to mark a task as done is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `done <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel.

Tasks can be marked done after they have been completed. Tasks marked as done will not appear in the main list, but can be viewed by the **LIST** command.<br>

<br> For example: <br>

Letâ€™s say task index â€?**1**â€? refers to the task `do laundry monday 4pm`

*   `done 1` will mark the `do laundry` task as done.

### 5. **EDIT** a Task

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `edit <task index> <new task> [new date1] [new date2] [-h | -m | -l] ` <br>

  * `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel.

<br> For example: <br>

Letâ€™s say task index â€?**1**â€? refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*  `edit 1 wash dishes tuesday 6pm -h` will edit the existing `wash dishes` task to `use dishes` and change the date from **monday** to **tuesday** , time from **4pm** to **6pm** and priority from **medium** to **high**.

<br>
### 6. **UNDO**

The `undo` command will undo the previous commands you have entered in the session.  

<br> For example : <br>
Entering `undo` after executing `delete 2` will bring back the deleted task.

### 7. **REDO**

The `redo` command will redo the previous `undo` you have executed in the session.  

### 8. **SEARCH** for Tasks

The format to search for certain tasks is :  
Â  Â  `search <keyword>`  

*   The tasks you are looking for can be obtained by typing in any word that is contained within the tasks' messages.

For example:  

Let say there is a task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `search dishes` will show the existing `wash dishes` task.

<br>

### 9. **SORT** Tasks

The format to sort a list of tasks is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `sort < date | name >`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified.

For example:
>   *   `sort date` will sort the list of tasks based on their dates, displaying the closest deadlines at the top.
>   *   `sort name` will sort the list lexicographically. 

<br>

### 10. **STORAGE** 

The format to change storage location is :
  <br>  `storage <filepath>` <br>

The storage command can be used to change the storage location of tasks. Tasks are stored on your computer in an XML file.

<br> For example : <br>

Entering `storage C://users/JohnDoe/NewFile.xml` will change the storage location to NewFile.xml.

>   *  Filepath must be of an XML file.
>   *  If the XML file mentioned at the filepath does not exist, a new XML file will be created by TaskTracker at the specified location.
>   *  All data of the pre-existing tasks will be copied to the new XML file.

```
