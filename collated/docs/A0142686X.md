### 4. **DONE** TASK

Tasks can be marked done after they have been completed. Tasks marked as done will not appear in the main list, but can be viewed by the list command (see LIST).<br>

The format to mark a task as done is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `done <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel, or by using the list 

<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `do laundry monday 4pm`

*   `done 1` will mark the `do laundry` task as done.

### 5. **LIST** Tasks

Tasks can be listed according to their priority, date when they are due or if they are marked done.
The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `list [date | priority | done]`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified. If no parameters given, the tasks are organized by date.
>   *   done parameter will list all the tasks marked done.
>   *   Both date and priority can be specified at the same time.

<br> For example : <br>
`list 9 Oct`  will display all tasks due on 9th October.
`list high` will display all tasks of high priority.
`list` will display all tasks organised by date.
`list high today` will display all tasks of high priority due today.
`list done` will display all the tasks marked done.
`list done today` will display all the done tasks which were due today.

### 6. **UNDO**

Enter `undo` into the command line to undo the previous commands you have entered in the session.  

<br> For example : <br>
Entering `undo` after executing `delete 2` will bring back the deleted task.

### 7. **REDO**

Enter `redo` into the command line to redo the previous undo you have executed in the session.  

### 8. **SEARCH** for Tasks

The format to search for certain tasks is :  
    `search <keyword>`  

*   The tasks you are looking for can be obtained by typing in any word that is contained within the tasks' messages.

For example:  

Let say task index **1** refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `search dishes` will show the existing `wash dishes` task.

### 9. **STORAGE** 
The storage command can be used to change the storage location of tasks. Tasks are stored on the PC in an XML file.

The format to change storage location is :
    `storage <filepath>`

<br> For example : <br>

Entering `storage C://users/JohnDoe/NewFile.xml` will change the storage location to NewFile.xml.

>   *  Filepath must be of an XML file.
>   *  If the XML file mentioned at the filepath does not exist, a new XML file will be created by TaskTracker at the specified location.
>   *  All data of the pre-existing tasks will be copied to the new XML file.


### 10. **HELP**

Enter `help` into the command line to list out all the commands available in T-T.

#### Storage component

![Storage](images/A_storage.png)<br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/main/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
  - can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
  - can save the Task-Tracker data in xml format and read it back.

#### Common classes

The classes used by multiple components are in the `tasktracker.main.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

####Logging Levels

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`)

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Code Quality Evaluation

We use [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) to perform testing and evaluation on the code quality and report issues on our projects.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task-Tracker Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
    >   * Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
    >   * Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>
    
```
