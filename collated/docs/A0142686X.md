#### Storage component

![Storage](images/A_storage.png)<br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/main/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
  - can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
  - can save the Task-Tracker data in xml format and read it back.

#### Common classes

The classes used by multiple components are in the `tasktracker.main.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

####Logging Levels

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`)

###4. LIST Tasks

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `list [date | priority]`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified. If no parameters given, the tasks are organized by date.
>   *   Both date and priority can be specified at the same time.

<br> For example : <br>
`list 9 Oct`  will display all tasks due on 9th October.
`list high` will display all tasks of high priority.
`list` will display all tasks organised by date.
`list high today` will display all tasks of high priority due today.

<br>

### 5. Undo a Task

Enter `undo` into the command line to the previous commands you have entered in the session.  

### 6. Search for Tasks

The format to search for certain tasks is :  
    `search <keyword>`  

*   The tasks you are looking for can be obtained by typing in any word that is contained within the tasks' messages.

For example:  

Let say task index **1** refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `search dishes` will show the existing `wash dishes` task.

### 7. HELP command

Enter `help` into the command line to list out all the commands available in T-T.

## **T-T List Statistics**

T-T also provides an intuitive listing the number of tasks stored, giving you a clearer idea on how to better deal with them. As seen in **the example below**, the numbers are displayed on the right of the task list. 

T-T's list statistics provides data on all the different types of tasks available in storage:

    -      Today's Tasks 
    -      Tomorrow's Tasks
    -      Event Tasks (Tasks with parameters all filled.)
    -      Deadline Tasks (Tasks which are much due much later)
    -      Floating Tasks (Tasks with incomplete parameters)
