# About Us
---

We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), doing this project for our [CS2103](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/) module. We hope this app proves to be useful for people and that this app's scope is not limited solely to our module project.

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish 
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.
  
### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**<br>

>Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.

**Solution**: Refresh the project in Eclipse:
Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
>Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.

**Solution**: Run tests using Gradle once (to refresh the libraries).

 

## Design

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given below explains the high-level design of the App, showing which components interact with which other components.<br>
![Architecture](images/A_overall.png)<br>
Given below is a quick overview of each component.
<br>
####Main
`Main` has only one class called [`Main`](). It is responsible for:
* Launching app: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* Shutting down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

####Commons
[`Commons`]() represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used for interaction between componenets.(a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>
The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
  - Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
  - Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.
![Sequence Diagram](images/delete_command.png)
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskTrackerChangedEvent` when the T-T data are changed,instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the '**Last Updated**' time. <br>
![Sequence Diagram](images/events_center.png)
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

## **About**

**_Task Tracker_ (T-T)** is an easy-to-use software which helps you manage your daily tasks. It is a simple and fun product which uses a creative Graphical User Interface to make the operations quick, easy and intuitive.

## **Quick Start**

**T-T** is easy to install and run.

> Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed on your PC.

In order to install **T-T**, 

1.  Download the latest task-tracker.jar file from https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/releases.
2.  Move the file to the directory in your computer where you want to install T-T.
3.  Double-click on the file to to start the app.


## **Commands**

**T-T** has a wide range of commands which can be used to add, delete, modify and manage everyday tasks. **T-T** supports 3 different kinds of tasks : 

1.  Event tasks (tasks with a start time and end time)
2.  Deadline tasks (tasks with a deadline)
3.  Floating Tasks (tasks with no start time, end time or deadline)

There are also 3 kinds of priorities which can be specified for each task- HIGH, NORMAL and LOW.


##### `<>` _indicates that field is compulsory_ and `[]` _indicates that field is optional._ 

### 1. **ADD**

You can use the ADD command to add tasks into **T-T**.

The format for adding a new task is: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   `add <task> [date1] [date2] [-h | -m | -l]` <br>

```
###### \UserGuide.md

### 10. **HELP**

You can use the HELP command for a list of all the commands and their parameters.

The format to use help command is to simply type : 
&nbsp; &nbsp; `help` <br>

The `help` command will open a window which lists all the available commands in T-T.

## **Unique Features**

**T-T** incorporates some unique features which differentiates it from the rest of the products in the market. These added features take T-T fun and easy to use!

### 1. List Statistics
**T-T**  provides an intuitive listing of the number of tasks stored, giving you a clearer idea on how to better deal with them. As seen in **the example below**, the numbers are displayed on the right of the task list. 

**T-T**'s list statistics provides data on all the different types of tasks available in storage:

* Today's Tasks 
* Tomorrow's Tasks
* Event Tasks (Tasks with two dates specified)
* Deadline Tasks (Tasks only one date specified)
* Floating Tasks (Tasks with no date specified)  
* Overdue Tasks (Tasks whose date has passed)
* Total Tasks 

<img src="images/List_Statistics.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>



### 2. Overdue Detection
Apart from the three basic colors shown earlier to indicate different priorities, **T-T** uses black tabs to indicate which tasks are overdue. If the current time has overshot an event task's endtime or a deadline task's deadline, the corresponding task will be shown with a black tab, as shown below. 

<br>
<img src="images/overdue_detection.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>

### 3. Autocomplete
Users who find typing in the many commands **T-T** provides too tedious may opt to use the autocomplete function the app has as well. Simply press the `Tab` key and you will be able to cycle through all the different commands. 

If you already have a command in mind, simply type the first letter of the command and press TAB. Autocomplete will fill out the rest of the command.

For example:  

Let say you were to enter a letter `d` in the **T-T** command box, by pressing `Tab`, the following commands can be toggled to easily.

*   `delete`
*   `done`

However, the autocompletion does not stop there. Sometimes users do need to reenter past commands. By pressing the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys, you can also access your most recent commands without having to tediously type it out again. 

### 4. Color Toggle
The user interface is not just limited to just one color. **T-T** offers you a variety of seven color themes to choose from. 

By pressing `F1` and `F2`, you can toggle between the different themes and choose any which suit your liking. 

<br>
<img src="images/color_toggle.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>

### 5. Minimize Window
Once you are done with adding and modifying tasks in **T-T**, you can simply press `Esc` to minimize the window.
