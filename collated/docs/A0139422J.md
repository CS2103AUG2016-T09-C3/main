# About Us
---

We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), doing this project for our [CS2103](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/) module. We hope this app proves to be useful for people and that this app's scope is not limited solely to our module project.

## **About**

**_Task Tracker_ (T-T)** is an easy-to-use software which helps you manage your daily tasks. It is a simple and fun product which uses a creative Graphical User Interface to make the operations quick, easy and intuitive.

## **Quick Start**

T-T is a lightweight app which does not require much time to install and run. 

> Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed on your PC.

In order to install T-T, 

1. Download the T-T files from https://github.com/t09-c3/task-tracker
2. Double-click on the T-T.jar file to start the app.<br>

## **Commands**

`<>` _indicates that field is compulsory_ and `[]` _indicates that field is optional._ 

###1. **ADD** a Task

The format for adding a new task is: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   `add <task> [date1] [date2] [-h | -m | -l]` <br>

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish 
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.
  
### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**<br>

>Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.

**Solution**: Refresh the project in Eclipse:
Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
>Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.

**Solution**: Run tests using Gradle once (to refresh the libraries).

 

## Design

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given below explains the high-level design of the App, showing which components interact with which other components.<br>
![Architecture](images/A_overall.png)<br>
Given below is a quick overview of each component.
<br>
####Main
`Main` has only one class called [`Main`](). It is responsible for:
* Launching app: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* Shutting down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

####Commons
[`Commons`]() represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used for interaction between componenets.(a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>
The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
  - Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
  - Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.
![Sequence Diagram](images/delete_command.png)
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskTrackerChangedEvent` when the T-T data are changed,instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the '**Last Updated**' time. <br>
![Sequence Diagram](images/events_center.png)
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.
