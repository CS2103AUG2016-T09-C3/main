# About Us
---

We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), doing this project for our [CS2103](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/) module. We hope this app proves to be useful for people and that this app's scope is not limited solely to our module project.

## **About**

**_Task Tracker_ (T-T)** is an easy-to-use software which helps you manage your daily tasks. It is a simple and fun product which uses a creative Graphical User Interface to make the operations quick, easy and intuitive.

## **Quick Start**

T-T is a lightweight app which does not require much time to install and run. 

> Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed on your PC.

In order to install T-T, 

1. Download the T-T files from https://github.com/t09-c3/task-tracker
2. Double-click on the T-T.jar file to start the app.<br>

## **Commands**

`<>` _indicates that field is compulsory_ and `[]` _indicates that field is optional._ 

### 1. **ADD** a Task

The format for adding a new task is: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   `add <task> [date1] [date2] [-h | -m | -l]` <br>

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
## **Unique Features**

### 1. List Statistics
**T-T** also provides an intuitive listing the number of tasks stored, giving you a clearer idea on how to better deal with them. As seen in **the example below**, the numbers are displayed on the right of the task list. 

**T-T**'s list statistics provides data on all the different types of tasks available in storage:

    -      Today's Tasks 
    -      Tomorrow's Tasks
    -      Event Tasks (Tasks with parameters all filled.)
    -      Deadline Tasks (Tasks which are much due much later)
    -      Floating Tasks (Tasks with incomplete parameters)  
<br>
![List Screen](images/List_Statistics.png)
<br>

### 2. Overdue Detection
Apart from the three basic colors shown earlier to indicate different priorities, T-T also indicates to users which tasks have become overdued. If the current time has overshot an event task's endtime or a deadline task's deadline, the corresponding task will be shown with a black tab, as shown below. 

### 3. Autocompletion
Users who find typing in the many commands **T-T** provides too tedious may opt to use the autocompletion function the app has as well. Simply press the `Tab` key and you will be able to cycle through all the different command. 

If you already have a command in mind, the function will be able to know simply from the first few letter you enter. 

For example:  

Let say you were to enter a letter `d` in the **T-T** command box, by pressing `Tab`, the following commands can be toggled to easily.

*   `delete`
*   `done`

However, the autocompletion does not stop there. Sometimes users do need to reenter past commands. By pressing the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys, you can also access your most recent commands without having to tediously type it out again. 

### 4. Color Toggling
The user interface is not just limited to just one color. **T-T** offers you a variety of seven color themes to choose from. 

By pressing `F1` and `F2`, you can toggle between the different themes and choose any which suit your preference. 

### 5. Minimize Window
Once you are done with what you need to do in **T-T**, you can simply press `Esc` to minimize the window.

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
| Keyboard Shortcuts  | Function  |
|---|---|
| `UP`/`DOWN`   |  Toggles history of recent commands  |
| `F1`/`F2`  | Toggles **T-T** color theme |
| `PgUp`/`PgDn`  | Navigates the list of tasks |
| `Tab`  | Autocompletes user input |
| `Esc`  | Minimizes app |

## **FAQ**

**Q**: __How do I transfer my data to another Computer?__

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. <br>
<br>
**Q**: __How do check if I have the correct Java Version?__ 

**A**:  
     1. Click Start on the task bar. 
     2. Select Control Panel (or Settings > Control Panel) from the Start menu. The Control Panel is displayed. 
     3. Select Java. The Java Control Panel dialog box is displayed.
     4. NOTE: if the Control Panel is in Category mode and you cannot see the Java option, switch the Control Panel to Classic View. 
     5. Click the Java tab. 9 of 9 6. In the Java Application Runtime Setting box, click View. The JNLP Runtime Settings dialog box is displayed.
     6. In the Java Application Runtime Setting box, click View. The JNLP Runtime Settings dialog box is displayed.

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish 
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.
  
### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**<br>

>Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.

**Solution**: Refresh the project in Eclipse:
Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
>Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.

**Solution**: Run tests using Gradle once (to refresh the libraries).

 

## Design

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given below explains the high-level design of the App, showing which components interact with which other components.<br>
![Architecture](images/A_overall.png)<br>
Given below is a quick overview of each component.
<br>
####Main
`Main` has only one class called [`Main`](). It is responsible for:
* Launching app: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* Shutting down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

####Commons
[`Commons`]() represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used for interaction between componenets.(a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>
The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
  - Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
  - Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.
![Sequence Diagram](images/delete_command.png)
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskTrackerChangedEvent` when the T-T data are changed,instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the '**Last Updated**' time. <br>
![Sequence Diagram](images/events_center.png)
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.
