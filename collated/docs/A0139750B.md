### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task-Tracker Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives.<br>
    >   * Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
    >   * Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Testing 

Tests can be found in the ./src/test/java folder.

There are two types of tests:

**GUI Tests** - _System tests_ that test the entire application itself by stimulating user actions on the GUI. These tests are in ./src/test/java/guitests package.

**Non-GUI Tests** - Tests that does not involve GUI, namely:

* _Unit tests_ - tests that targets low level methods/classes<br>
		e.g src.test.java.commons.util.StringUtilTest
		
* _Integration Tests_ - Checks the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
		e.g src.test.java.storage.StorageManagerTest
		
* Hybrids of unit and integration tests - Tests that checks multiple code units as well as how they are connected together <br>
		e.g  src.test.java.logic.LogicManagerTest.java

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library that we are using, our GUI tests can be run in _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on his computer while the tests are running.<br>

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode
		
### Testing with Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on src/test/java folder and click `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

* You can also run tests individually or specific tests at one time, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

### Testing with Gradle

* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

## Appendix D : Glossary


## Appendix E : Product Survey

We did a market survey in order to study the existing products out there for the consumers. We looked at a wide variety of task managers- Taskwarrior, Calendar.vim, Gcalcli, Wunderlist, Todo.txt and Evernote. We will talk about the strengths and flaws of each of them.

`Taskwarrior` is a free and open source software that uses the command line. Its biggest strength is its simple user interface and lightweight design. However, it does not support reminders and is only available for Linux and OSX.

`Calendar.vim` is another software we studied. It is an only-Linux software which runs via the vim text editor. It too is lightweight and utilises a CLI to perform its operations. But it does not support subtasks, has no possibility of syncing with other calendars such as Google Calendar, and has no reminders. It is very basic in its operations. Gcalcli is also Linux and OSX based, and supports reminders also, but it doesnt work offline.

Moving on to **GUI** task managers. `Wunderlist` is a popular task manager software. It has Google integration,  supports integration, has reminders and is available on multiple platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. But it doesnt support subtasks.

`Todo.txt` is another GUI task manager which is available on many platforms and is free. Its drawbacks are that it has no reminders or support for subtasks.
`Evernote` was the most popular task manager we studied. It supports Google integration and subtasks, is available across multiple platforms and has reminders. The only big drawback of Evernote is that it is not completely free and some features are available only after payment.
