## Appendix E : Product Survey

We did a market survey in order to study the existing products out there for the consumers. We looked at a wide variety of task managers- Taskwarrior, Calendar.vim, Gcalcli, Wunderlist, Todo.txt and Evernote. We will talk about the strengths and flaws of each of them.

`Taskwarrior` is a free and open source software that uses the command line. Its biggest strength is its simple user interface and lightweight design. However, it does not support reminders and is only available for Linux and OSX.

`Calendar.vim` is another software we studied. It is an only-Linux software which runs via the vim text editor. It too is lightweight and utilises a CLI to perform its operations. But it does not support subtasks, has no possibility of syncing with other calendars such as Google Calendar, and has no reminders. It is very basic in its operations. Gcalcli is also Linux and OSX based, and supports reminders also, but it doesnt work offline.

Moving on to **GUI** task managers. `Wunderlist` is a popular task manager software. It has Google integration,  supports integration, has reminders and is available on multiple platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. But it doesnt support subtasks.

`Todo.txt` is another GUI task manager which is available on many platforms and is free. Its drawbacks are that it has no reminders or support for subtasks.
`Evernote` was the most popular task manager we studied. It supports Google integration and subtasks, is available across multiple platforms and has reminders. The only big drawback of Evernote is that it is not completely free and some features are available only after payment.
