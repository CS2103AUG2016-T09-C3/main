### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task-Tracker Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
    >   * Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
    >   * Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix D : Glossary

## Appendix E : Product Survey

We did a market survey in order to study the existing products out there for the consumers. We looked at a wide variety of task managers- Taskwarrior, Calendar.vim, Gcalcli, Wunderlist, Todo.txt and Evernote. We will talk about the strengths and flaws of each of them.

`Taskwarrior` is a free and open source software that uses the command line. Its biggest strength is its simple user interface and lightweight design. However, it does not support reminders and is only available for Linux and OSX.

`Calendar.vim` is another software we studied. It is an only-Linux software which runs via the vim text editor. It too is lightweight and utilises a CLI to perform its operations. But it does not support subtasks, has no possibility of syncing with other calendars such as Google Calendar, and has no reminders. It is very basic in its operations. Gcalcli is also Linux and OSX based, and supports reminders also, but it doesn’t work offline.

Moving on to **GUI** task managers. `Wunderlist` is a popular task manager software. It has Google integration,  supports integration, has reminders and is available on multiple platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. But it doesn’t support subtasks.

`Todo.txt` is another GUI task manager which is available on many platforms and is free. Its drawbacks are that it has no reminders or support for subtasks.
`Evernote` was the most popular task manager we studied. It supports Google integration and subtasks, is available across multiple platforms and has reminders. The only big drawback of Evernote is that it is not completely free and some features are available only after payment.

###3. DELETE a Task

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `delete <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel, or by using the list 


<br> For example: <br>

Letâ€™s say task index â€œ**1**â€? refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `delete 1` will delete the aforementioned `wash dishes` task.

###4. LIST Tasks

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `list [date | priority]`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified. If no parameters given, the tasks are organized by date.
>   *   Both date and priority can be specified at the same time.

<br> For example : <br>
`list 9 Oct`  will display all tasks due on 9th October.
`list high` will display all tasks of high priority.
`list` will display all tasks organised by date.
`list high today` will display all tasks of high priority due today.

<br>

### 5. Undo a Task

Enter `undo` into the command line to the previous commands you have entered in the session.  

### 6. Search for Tasks

The format to search for certain tasks is :  
Â  Â  `search <keyword>`  

*   The tasks you are looking for can be obtained by typing in any word that is contained within the tasks' messages.

For example:  

Let say task index **1** refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `search dishes` will show the existing `wash dishes` task.

### 7. HELP command

Enter `help` into the command line to list out all the commands available in T-T.

## **T-T List Statistics**

T-T also provides an intuitive listing the number of tasks stored, giving you a clearer idea on how to better deal with them. As seen in **the example below**, the numbers are displayed on the right of the task list. 

T-T's list statistics provides data on all the different types of tasks available in storage:

    -      Today's Tasks 
    -      Tomorrow's Tasks
    -      Event Tasks (Tasks with parameters all filled.)
    -      Deadline Tasks (Tasks which are much due much later)
    -      Floating Tasks (Tasks with incomplete parameters)  
<br>
