*  T-T can accept flexible date formats. Examples are:
    *  `today`
    *  `monday`(to set the date as next monday)
    *  `31 Oct`
*   If **no date** is specified, the task will be assumed to be a **floating task** which is an action whose deadline is indefinite.
*   You do not need to specify any dates. You can specify only 1 date or 2 dates.
    *   If **1 date** is written, it would be taken as the deadline.
    -   If **2 date** is written, they would be the start and end times for the task.

*   `[-h | -l]` refers to the priority of the task. 
    *   `-h` means **high** priority. 
    *   `-m` means **medium** priority.
    *   `-l` means **low** priority.
    *   If not specified, priority is **medium**.
    *   Except for `<task>`, the other parameters can be inputed in any order.

<br>For example:<br>
*   `•  add wash dishes monday 4pm -h ` will create a high priority `wash dishes` task to be done on the **next Monday**.
*   `•  add call mum tmr ` will create a task named `call mum` to be done anytime on **the next day** with **normal** priority.<br>

###2. EDIT a Task

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `edit <task index> <new task> [new date1] [new date2] [-h | -m | -l] ` <br>

  * `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel, or by using the list command (See **List** command).

<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*  `edit 1 wash dishes tuesday 6pm -h` will edit the existing `wash dishes` task to `use dishes` and change the date from **monday** to **tuesday** , time from **4pm** to **6pm** and priority from **medium** to **high**.

###3. DELETE a Task

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `delete <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel, or by using the list 


<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `delete 1` will delete the aforementioned `wash dishes` task.

####Logic
![Logic](images/A_Logic.png)<br>
**API** : [`Logic.java`]()

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.


####UI
![UI](images/A_UI.png)<br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`]()

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`]() is specified in[`MainWindow.fxml`]()

The `UI` component,
  - Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
  - Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
  - Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

####Model
![Model](images/A_Model.png)<br>

**API** : [`Model.java`]()

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the task data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
