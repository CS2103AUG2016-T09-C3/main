####Logic
![Logic](images/Logic.png)<br>
**API** : [`Logic.java`]()

* `Logic` uses the `MainParser` class to parse the user command.
* `MainParser` class uses `TimeParser` to parse part of the input.
* `MainParser` returns a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* Execution of `Command` object can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
* `AutoComplete` class is initialized by `Logic`, and reacts to certain events like when <kbd>tab</kbd> is pressed.
* `AutoComplete` uses `SetTrie` class to provide suggestions quickly.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

####UI
![UI](images/A_UI.png)<br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`]()

* `MainWindow` class is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ListStatistics` etc.
* All individual UI sub components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.
* JavaFx UI framework is used. 
* The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br> For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`]() is specified in[`MainWindow.fxml`]()
* User commands are executed using the `Logic` component.
* UI auto-updates when data in the `Model` change.
* UI responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates itself accordingly.

####Model
![Model](images/Model.png)<br>

**API** : [`Model.java`]()

* The `Model` component uses various classes to construct and model the data of TaskTracker in memory.
* `UserPref` object represents the user's preferences.
* The `ModelManager` implements `Model` interface, providing access to the model data as well as encapsulating the complexity of its in-built classes. All external components can only interact with the model data via the ModelManager class.
* Task data is stored in `TaskTracker` class.
* The TaskTracker class stores the lists of tasks, only the `ReadOnlyTaskTracker` or `Model` interface grants access to its data.
* The task class models three different types of classes - floating, deadline and event tasks
* Each of these tasks contains certain fields specific to their own types
* `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` is 'exposed', so list of tasks can be observed, for example by the UI, without being changed.

*  T-T can accept flexible date formats. Examples are:
    *  `today`
    *  `monday`(to set the date as next monday)
    *  `31 Oct`
*   If **no date** is specified, the task will be assumed to be a **floating task** which is an action whose deadline is indefinite.
*   You do not need to specify any dates. You can specify only 1 date or 2 dates.
    *   If **1 date** is written, it would be taken as the deadline.
    -   If **2 date** is written, they would be the start and end times for the task.

*   `[-h | -l]` refers to the priority of the task. 
    *   `-h` means **high** priority. 
    *   `-m` means **medium** priority.
    *   `-l` means **low** priority.
    *   If not specified, priority is **medium**.
    *   Except for `<task>`, the other parameters can be inputed in any order.

<br>For example:<br>
*   ` add wash dishes monday 4pm -h ` will create a high priority `wash dishes` task to be done on the **next Monday**.
*   ` add call mum tmr ` will create a task named `call mum` to be done anytime on **the next day** with **normal** priority.<br>

### 2. **LIST** Tasks

The format to list tasks is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `list [date | priority | done]`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified. If no parameters given, the tasks are organized by date.
>   *   done parameter will list all the tasks marked done.
>   *   Both date and priority can be specified at the same time.

Tasks can be listed according to their priority, date when they are due or if they are marked as done.

<br> For example : <br>
* `list` will display all tasks organised by date.
* `list 9 Oct`  will display all tasks due on 9th October.
* `list high` will display all tasks of high priority.
* `list high today` will display all tasks of high priority due today.
* `list done` will display all the tasks marked done.
* `list done today` will display all the done tasks which were due today.

### 3. **DELETE** a Task

The format to delete an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `delete <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel.


<br> For example: <br>

Letâ€™s say task index â€?**1**â€? refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `delete 1` will delete the aforementioned `wash dishes` task.
