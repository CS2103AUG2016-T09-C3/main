>*  T-T can accept flexible date formats. Examples are:
    *  `today`
    *  `monday`(to set the date as next monday)
    *  `31 Oct`
*   If **no date** is specified, the task will be assumed to be a **floating task** which is an action whose deadline is indefinite.
*   If one or two dates are specified :
    *   If **one date** is written, it would be taken as the deadline.
    -   If **two dates** are written, they would be the start and end times for the task.
*   `[-h | -l]` refers to the priority of the task. 
    *   `-h` means **high** priority. The task will be coloured red.
    *   `-m` means **medium** priority. The task will be coloured orange.
    *   `-l` means **low** priority. The task will be coloured green.
    *   If not specified, priority is **medium**.
    
*   Except for `<task>`, the other parameters can be inputed in any order.

<br>For example:<br>
*   ` add wash dishes monday 4pm -h ` will create a high priority `wash dishes` task to be done on the **next Monday**.
<img src="images/add_command1.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>
<br>
*   ` add call mum tmr ` will create a task named `call mum` to be done anytime on **the next day** with **normal** priority.<br>

<img src="images/Add_Command2.png" height="600p" width="750p"><br>

### 2. **LIST**

You can use the LIST command to list tasks according to different parameters such as  date, priority or tasks which are marked done.

The format to list tasks is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `list [date | priority | done |overdue]`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified. If no parameters given, the tasks are organized by **date**.
>   *   **done** parameter will list all the tasks marked done.
>   *   **overdue** parameter will list all tasks which are overdue.
>   *   Any number of parameters can be specified at the same time.

Tasks can be listed according to their priority, date when they are due or if they are marked as done.

<br> For example : <br>
* `list` will display all tasks organised by date.
* `list 9 Oct`  will display all tasks due on 9th October.
* `list high` will display all tasks of high priority.
* `list high today` will display all tasks of high priority due today.
* `list done` will display all the tasks marked done.
* `list done today` will display all the done tasks which were due today.
* `list overdue` will display all tasks which are overdue.

### 3. **DELETE**

You can use the DELETE command to delete existing tasks in **T-T**.

The format to delete an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `delete <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` is the number displayed alongside the task in the list panel.


<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `delete 1` will delete the aforementioned `wash dishes` task.

#### Logic
[`Logic`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/logic/Logic.java) is exposed through [`LogicManager`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/logic/LogicManager.java), and consists of 3 main packages headed by the following classes, [`MainParser`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/logic/parser/MainParser.java), [`Command`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/tree/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/logic/command) and [`AutoComplete`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/logic/autocomplete/AutoComplete.java). The Logic class diagram is shown below.
![Logic](images/Logic.png)<br>
**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/tree/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/logic)

* `Logic` uses the `MainParser` class to parse the user command.
* `MainParser` class uses `TimeParser` to parse part of the input.
* `MainParser` returns a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* Execution of `Command` object can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
* `AutoComplete` class is initialized by `Logic`, and reacts to certain events like when <kbd>tab</kbd> is pressed.
* `AutoComplete` uses `SetTrie` class to provide suggestions quickly.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
`LogicManager` passes `MainParser` to input to parse, and gets back a `DeleteCommand` object which it executes to get a `CommandResult` object. `Model` is also edited in the process.

#### UI
[`UI`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/Ui.java) is exposed through [`UIManager`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/UiManager.java), and consists of a MainWindow, which is made up of [`CommandBox`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/CommandBox.java), [`ResultDisplay`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/ResultDisplay.java), [`TaskListPanel`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/TaskListPanel.java), [`StatusBarFooter`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/StatusBarFooter.java), [`ListStatistics`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/ListStatistics.java) and [`HelpWindow`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/ui/HelpWindow.java). The UI class diagram is shown below. 
![UI](images/A_UI.png)<br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`]()

* All individual UI sub components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.
* JavaFx UI framework is used. 
* The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br> For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`]() is specified in[`MainWindow.fxml`]()
* User commands are executed using the `Logic` component.
* UI auto-updates when data in the `Model` change.
* UI responds to events raised from various parts of the App, such as `Model` and updates itself accordingly.

#### Model
The `Model` component uses various classes to construct and model the data of TaskTracker in memory. [`ModelManager`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/model/ModelManager.java) implements [`Model`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/model/Model.java) interface, providing access to the model data as well as encapsulating the complexity of its in-built classes. All external components can only interact with the model data via the [`ModelManager`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/model/ModelManager.java) class.
![Model](images/Model.png)<br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C3/main/blob/master/task-tracker/src/main/java/main/model/Model.java)

* `UserPref` object represents the user's preferences.
* Task data is stored in `TaskTracker` class.
* The task class models three different types of classes - floating, deadline and event tasks
* Each of these tasks contains certain fields specific to their own types
* `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` is 'exposed', so list of tasks can be observed, for example by the `UI`, without being changed.
